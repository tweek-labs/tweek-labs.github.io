              A base layer (aka compression layer or skin) from Tweek, which is a figure fitting 
              garment worn inside the jersey. Kompress comes as a top and a lower to cover the full 
              body of the player. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Kompress has locations throughout the body where a Tweek Lambda Module can be placed to 
              begin motion tracking of a player. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Kompress provides thermal and moisture regulation by taking away sweat from the body 
              during practice sessions and physical activity. Dry skin makes sure that the player 
              doesn’t feel irritation in their skin during or after the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              Kompress is made to keep muscles compressed during and after practice sessions. This 
              compression has been proven by research to relieve muscle pain and fatigue by maintaining 
              the heat released by the body. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Kompress reduces the risk of injuries during and after practice sessions because of the 
              properties of thermal regulation and muscle compression.

                We can detect on the field if a player is repeating a mixed action rather than a pure 
                side on or front on action. A mixed action can be lethal for the player’s career and 
                we believe it is crucial to detect such harmful action early on in a player’s career.

                The movement of the body and the centre of gravity for a batsman and a bowler determines

                momentum of the player in different parts of the game.

                During batting and bowling, the stability of the head is something extremely essential 
                for the balance of the body and control over the delivery or the swing of the bat. We 
                give the head movement analysis of the player in the duration of their session and give 
                overall feedback about the player’s head movement throughout the session.

                Feet movement of a player determines the rhythm and speed of a fast bowler. For a batsman, 
                the footwork helps them transfer their weight towards the delivery and helps them maintain 
                balance and control over it. We give analysis of the foot movement based on the context of 
                bowling and batting and its implication on the  performance of the player.
